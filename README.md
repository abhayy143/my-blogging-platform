## Setup & Installation üëã

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blogging-platform.git
```
### 2. Install Dependecies

Navigate into the project directory and install the required dependencies.

```bash
cd blogging-platform
npm install
```

### 3. Firebase Setup

- Create a project in Firebase Console. 
- Go to Firestore Database and create a collection named *blogs*.
- Now, go to your Firebase project *settings*.
- Find the _Your Applications_ section, which will probably be under the *General* tab.
- Create an *application* for your project on the desired platform. (In our case, a _Web App_)
- You will see your project configuration keys.
- Add your Firebase configuration to *firebase.js*.

```bash
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

// Your Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
  measurementId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore(app);

export { db };
```

### 4. Add Firebase API Keys to *.env* file

Create a *.env* file in the root of your project and add your Firebase API keys.

```bash
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```

### 5. Start the Development Server.

Once the dependencies are installed and the Firebase config is set up, start the development server. 

```bash
npm start
```

Your app should be live at http://localhost:3000

## Deployment

You can deploy the app using Vercel:

- Sign up or log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Click on New Project and import your GitHub repository.
- Follow the prompts and click Deploy.

After deployment, your project will be live on a unique Vercel URL.


## Dark Mode Toggle 

You can switch between Light Mode and Dark Mode by clicking the "Switch to Dark Mode" or "Switch to Light Mode" button located at the top. This will toggle the theme for the entire website.
